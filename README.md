# Coin price prediction based-on LSTM 
I have build a very simple LSTM model to predict price ofsome cryptocurrencies (bitcoin, ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar...). The price data gathered from [this website](https://coinmarketcap.com/), you can check it out. <br/>
Here are some results:

I will build a RESTful API for the model as soon as possible. And you can contribute this project. Please contact me!
